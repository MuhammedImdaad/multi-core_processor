# multi-core_processor
Quad core processor for matrix multiplication designed for FPGA using Verilog HDL

* run the IO_handler.py to fill in the input matrices
* once the script is halted, run the simulation (top_module_tb.v)
* wait for the processing ends, this should output the time it takes to process the input
* then type ok in the python script, this will display the resultant matrix
